Ecommerce site using React , redux and firebase.

To use, clone it . 

Make sure you have yarn or npm installed.

Then in your terminal pointing to the cloned project, run yarn or npm install.

To use firebase please go to google developers console, start a new project, start a new collection of users and obtain your own api key.

Some of the work done here ,say implementing a search-box, is experimental and not needed in some parts of the application. One can simply conditionally render it just on the individual collections page.

I also need to improve the UI for a detailed individual product page.

After yarn or npm install, simply enter yarn start.
